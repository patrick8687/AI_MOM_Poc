`.env` — Purpose

- Purpose: Store environment variables such as `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (not checked into source control).
- Typical content: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
- Where to edit: populate with your API credentials before running the app.
- Notes: Keep this file secret; add `.env` to `.gitignore` for repo safety.
